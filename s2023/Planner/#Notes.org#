* CALCULUS AGENDA
** Course Schedule and Things to be doing
*** Need to pay attention to 7.1 - 7.7
*** The goal for this week is to actually finish all of the assignments before the second week when the tests get dropped off to the centers
*** TODO I need to look at my mistakes for calclus II exam II.
**** I need to do a heavier reflection on what happens with my exams and why this class is so difficult.


* ROAMING NOTES
** TODO Learn how to use anki and spaced repition
*** I want to be able to use srr for things like calculus and physics, which I guess I'll need to learn hwo to do because it doesn't seem very intuitive at the moment.
** TODO Learn how to use Latex or other math writing software with emacs in order to get better and more efficent notes.
*** Right not it doesn't really matter since I have a notebook and engineering paperm, but it might come back later to confuse me if I try to read my org notes.
** TODO Clean up syncthing folders that are shared currently with my desktop, linux/mac laptops.
*** I have a lot of empty folders and repeat folders, and I have obselete folders such as my m1 org agenda.
*** I should also condense my class folders and maybe save them even further into an external hard drive.
    #+NOTE: this shouldn't matter as much for now because most of my systems outside of the endeavor laptop have high storages.
** DONE Look over macbook m1 ORG planner and macbook arch planner and decide which one to use.
*** After looking closer, I decided to just use my arch linux setup and then share it through syncthing.
** DONE Add this org file over to my syncthing profile in order to see it on desktop and macbook
** DONE get doom emacs set up on pc, either that or start looking into the dual boot option
** TODO Cold call departments about undergraduate research. This summer.
*** I've talked to a few professors already:
- Dr. Berry, Dr. Qi, Dr. Aziz, and I think two more so far.
- Dr. Berry referred me to ICL lab, the otehrs have not responded yet.
- Need to talk to Dr. Knight for more networking and dad to see if anyone in DeRoyal or Denzo can take me.
    - To that point, I should look more into DeRoyal and Denzo since they are close to home.
#+Note: I I can probably do a much better job in writing my emails, I should probably send a universal version over to either Hank or sis and have them review and see if its too formal or too casual.



#+NOTE: I want to give org mode online note taking a try, but I will need the new ssd config to have emacs set up on my sharing ssd, will probably have to do a raid configuration and get rid of my old recovering or I will have to put that recovery on a flash boot drive.
