#+TITLE: Roaming Notes
#+AUTHOR: Isaac Abella
#+DESCRIPTION: Used for thoughts and notes that don't go into my planner at all. Will probably resort later or just mark out, but these are just plain text notes.

#+REMINDER: The C-c C-x C-a command string will add a subtree to the org archive, which means you can view it individaully, but it takes it out of the tree root that you made the note in so be careful!

Things that I need to do.
1. Review how taking notes on emacs felt with physics
2. Cold Emailing professors for work.
