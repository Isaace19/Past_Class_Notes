<h1> CS202 -- Lab Assignment 7 (150+25 pts: Fall 2023)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>

In this lab, you will gain familiarity with the binary search tree
data structure and the iterator abstraction. The first is a core data
structure. The latter is a core C++/STL concept.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
The bst.h file is due 11.59pm Thursday Nov 16, 2023.
Do not submit any cpp files. Your task is to update the binary search tree
template code which goes in the bst.h header file. 
The code must compile using the given makefile.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Programs you need to write </h3>

Write the following code. Start early as the assignment
may be more difficult than you first think.
Base your code on the bst1 handout, which uses left and right
pointers, not the bst2 handout, which uses a link array of 
pointers.</b>

<UL>
<LI>
Get a copy of lab7.tar from Canvas.
This file contains a file called Prog7.cpp,
which works as provided, a skeleton bst.h file called bst.txt 
which you must complete the implementation of, and
a makefile for compiling the program into an executable.
In addition, you are given a solution executable called sprog7,
and some test data.
The executable showcases the functionality described next.
When in doubt about what to do, run the solution 
executables and study the output.
Make sure your program works on data other than the test files
given to you.
<p>

<LI> 
The main program takes two required command line options that specify the mode and the data used as well as an optional verbose option. Execution examples are as follows:

<pre>
unix> ./Prog7 
usage: ./Prog7 -1|2|3|4 [-verbose] data.txt
unix> cat ../test_char.txt
H
W
B
E
T
F

unix> ./prog7 -1 ../test_char.txt
  0   H : ROOT  L=  2 R=  1
  2   B : P=  0       R=  3
  1   W : P=  0 L=  4
  3   E : P=  2       R=  5
  4   T : P=  1
  5   F : P=  3

unix> ./prog7 -2 ../test_char.txt
   B   E   F   H   T   W

unix> ./prog7 -3 -verbose ../test_char.txt
   B   E   F   H   T   W

Print [key0:key1] A O
*** lower bound B
*** upper bound T
   B   E   F   H

Print [key0:key1] K X
*** lower bound T
*** upper bound NA
   T   W

Print [key0:key1] ^D

unix> ./prog7 -4 -verbose ../test_char.txt
   W   T   H   F   E   B

Print [key0:key1] A O
*** lower bound B
*** upper bound T
   H   F   E   B

Print [key0:key1] K X
*** lower bound T
*** upper bound NA
   W   T

Print [key0:key1] ^D
</pre>

Mode 1 executes a level-by-level traversal and prints the node labels to stdout. 
Mode 2 executes an inorder traversal and prints the node labels to stdout using 
a forward iterator loop (operator++()).
Mode 3 repeats Mode 2 before entering an interactive loop that prints user
defined ranges of the data. Printing of the data is based on the same forward
iterator loop used in Mode 2.
Mode 4 is similar to Mode 2 but prints everything in reverse. This is based
a reverse iterator loop (operator--()). The verbose option is silently ignored
for Modes 1 and 2 and only takes effect for Modes 3 and 4.
<p>

NOTE: The level-by-level printout uses node IDs to identify parents nodes
and subtrees. That is, the root node has ID=0 and label=H. The left child has
ID=2 and label=B while the right child has ID=1 and label=W. Both children
have P=0 meaning the root node. The solution executable can only process
integer data as compiled.
<p>

Extra credit: Mode 4 is extra credit. If you succesfully implement Mode 2, then
you should not have much trouble implementing Mode 4.

<p>

<LI>
For 30 points,
complete the bst.h file needed to compile and run Mode 1 of the 
program. Here is what that entails.
<p>

Copy bst.txt to bst.h. Strip out comments as well as code not needed 
like the iterator subclass and undefined bst member functions.
Add a node ID (int) and a parent pointer (node *) 
to the bst::node subclass.
Define and implement the bst::node() constructor.
Have the constructor take a node ID argument which is set
to 0 if absent, and use this argument to initialize the node ID.
Set the parent pointer to NULL.
<p>

The node ID is a unique integer assigned to nodes as they
are created. Add a node ID to the bst class which is initialized to 0
in the bst constructor and updated everytime a new node is added to 
the binary search tree. Update bst::insert() to do the
latter and to pass the updated value along to the bst::node
constructor.
<p>

With respect to the parent pointer (or link),
be aware that bst::insert() is a recursive function which
does not have access to the parent when processing a node. 
You must therefore set the parent pointer as you ascend out 
of the recursion (when you reach the parent, you have access to the 
root of the subtree just processed).
<p>

Update bst::node::print() to output the node ID, its key,
the parent ID, and the left and right subtree IDs (if they exist).
See an integer output example below. 

<p>
Add a specialized version of bst::node::print() for string data. 
Make the key width 20. Temporarily modify Prog7.cpp to read string data,
then process test_string.txt and make sure you understand the output
produced by Modes 1 and 2. Then switch back to integer processing.
<p>

<LI>
For 80 points,
update bst.h compile and run Mode 2 of the program.
A quick look should convince you that this is a matter
of adding an iterator subclass to the bst class. Here
is how you do that.
<p>

Add public member functions bst::begin() and bst::end()
which respectively return an iterator that points to the node 
which holds the smallest key and an iterator that contains
a NULL pointer which indicates the binary
search tree has been exhausted (analogous to the first node
and the end of a single-linked list).
Recall that the smallest key is found in the leftmost node. You
must find it by <i>iteratively</i> searching thru the sequence of
left children starting at the root of the tree. 
<p>

The bst.txt file lists a number of iterator operators 
that must be included, namely:
++ PRE increment for an inorder move to the next node,
* for dereferencing and thus accessing the node key,
== and != for comparing iterators.
Base your code for these operators
on the list::iterator code covered in class.
This might be a good time
to read and understand the corresponding class notes 
and code handout which both are available on Canvas.
<p>

The ++ PRE increment operator is by far the most complicated
code you will write in this lab assignment.
Before you even think about programming it, make sure you
know how to carry out an inorder traversal with focus on
how to advance from one node to the next. Be aware that
you will NOT be using recursion. Each call to 
bst::iterator::operator++ must explicitly update the 
underlying node pointer to the next node.
<p>

Hint:
The bst::begin() function should the node pointer to the
leftmost node in the binary search tree. The next node
is the parent thereof. The next node after that is the 
leftmost node in the parent's right subtree (if it has any).
You then return to that node's parent before you process
it's right subtree. Eventually, you return to the root
of the tree whereafter you descend into the main
right subtree. See the pattern?
Be very careful when you ascend out of the tree when
the last node has been processed. You must
detect and handle an attempt to access the parent of the 
root node since it doesn't exist.
If you forget to this, your code will seg fault. Guaranteed.
<p>

When the bst::iterator subclass has been implemented, 
the print_inorder() function in Prog7.cpp will output
the content of the binary search tree in lexicographically 
sorted order as shown above. Make
sure your code produces a comparable result for the 
test_string.txt data.
<p>

<LI>
For 40 points, modify bst.h to compile and run Mode 3
of the program. 
A quick look should convince you that this is a matter
of adding two public member functions to the bst class,
namely, bst::lower_bound() and bst::upper_bound()
which both take a key as input and return an iterator
corresponding to node in the binary search tree.
Here is how these functions are supposed to work.
<p>

The bst::lower_bound(key) function returns an iterator to the
first node in the binary search tree whose key is not less
than the given key, i.e., key &le; lower_bound.
If the key exists, the returned iterator points to that node.
If the key does not exist, the returned iterator points to 
the first node whose key value is greater. 
Your search must be based on explicitly
traversing the appropriate path from the root to the target
node. Do not use an iterator based inorder traversal.
<p>

The bst::upper_bound() function returns an iterator to the
first node in the binary search tree whose key is strictly
greater than the given key, i.e., key &lt; upper_bound.
If the key exists, the returned iterator points to the next 
node when performing an inorder traversal.
If the max key does not exist, the returned 
iterator should represent a NULL pointer.
Your search must be based on explicitly
traversing the appropriate path from the root to the target
node. Again, do not use an iterator based inorder traversal.
<p>

Hint: bst::lower_bound() and bst::upper_bound() are nearly
identical; their only difference is wrt the comparison operator
used.
<p>

The iterators returned from bst::lower_bound() and
bst::upper_bound() are passed to print_inorder() 
which outputs the corresponding sequence of
data stored in the binary search tree.
See an example above.
<p>

<LI>
For 25 extra points, modify bst.h to compile and run Mode 4
program. 
A quick look should convince you that this is a matter
of updating the iterator subclass. Here
is how you do that.
<p>

<p>
Add public member functions bst::rbegin() and bst::rend()
which respectively return an iterator that points to the node 
which holds the largest key and an iterator that contains
a NULL pointer which indicates the binary
search tree has been exhausted.
Recall that the largest key is found in the rightmost node. You
must find it by <i>iteratively</i> searching thru the sequence of
right children starting at the root of the tree. 
<p>

Add PRE decrement operator -- for an inorder move to the 
previous node. If you understand how the forward operator works,
then it should be easy for you convert a copy thereof to produce
the needed reverse operator. See above for example output.
