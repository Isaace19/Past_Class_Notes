Problem 1
Determine the big-O expression for each of the following T(N) functions:
(a) T(N) = 2N + N ( N + 3)
(b) T(N) = 5
(c) T(N) = N + log N2
(d) T(N) = N ( 2 + log N )
(e) T(N) = log (2N)
(f) T(N) = 2N + N2 + 2N

Answer:
a) This is a quadratic time complexity we can simplify the given expression to 2N + N^2 + 3N which is a quadratic function
b) T(N) = 5 is a constant time complexity of 5. time complexity remains the same regardless of N.
c) T(N) = N + log N2 is a linear expression because you are only interseted in the time complexity that grows the fastest, and between the linear and 2logN expression, the linear N grows faster so we know that this is a linear expression.  
d) T(N) = N (2 + log + N) - N is growing independent of the logortihmic function, and when multiplying the outermost N, we can see that the logN grows slower than the linear term n, so this would be log-linear/linearithmic time complexity
e) log (2N) is a log complexity we can simplify log 2n with the rule of logirthms to get Olog (2) + Olog(N) = Olog(N) which is just logn complexity. 
f) T(N) = 2N + N2 + 2N is a quadratic time complexity

Problem 2
Given an array list, determine following big-O costs:
(a) Worst case cost associated with finding the ith element.
(b) Average cost for checking if a specific data value is present. All locations are equally likely.

a) The worst case sceario for attemtping to search the ith element with big O complexity would be trying to use a binary search on an array that is not sorted, or a linear search because the complexity will be O(N).
b) The average cost for checking if a specifc data value is present given that all locations are equally likely to be right would require the searching algorithm to look at each data element in the array until the element is actually.
	Given that Linear and Binary searches are the two worst case scenarios:
	Binary search would cost a Olog(N)
	Linear search would cost a O(N).

Problem 3
Given a linked list, determine following big-O costs:
(a) Worst case cost associated with finding the ith element.
(b) Average cost for checking if a specific data value is present. All locations are equally likely.

a) the worst case scenario for searching through a linked list, you must search through all the node elements, and since the search is relative to the size of the linked list, this makes the searching case a linear search 
b) this means that having to search through all the specific data points in this linked list will make the time complexity O(N)
