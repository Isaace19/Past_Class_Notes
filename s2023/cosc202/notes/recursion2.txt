enumeration and more recursion
==============================

successive halfing shift by 2 - dividing by 2
           generated from least significant bit to most significant bit

void dex2bin(int number){
     if(number == 0){
        return;
     }
     dec2bin(number/2);
     cout << (number%2);
}

this function is made as as stack data structure.

Iterative and Recursion, the relationship is the opposite. So you would do recursion as the opposite of iterative solutions.

Recrusion functions are being called and made on the stack, this way we can reverse the order. (stack datastructure can reverse order of lists)

Enumeration: Iterate through all elements in a set

number combinations

N
K notation              n!/k!(n-k)!
