Description: 4 Bit carry ripple adder VHDL code until I instal vivado on Ubuntu.


text file implementation of the VHDL code for a 4 bit carry ripple adder implemetnation.

writing out the code for just the carry ripple adder, assuming that the inputs entity and architecture for the inputs and output have been defined. 

// start

entity CRA is 
	port(...);		// differentiating the entity in the port list, you have to clarify the input and output
end CRA;

// define the archtecture of CRA

architecture struct of CRA is 
	// declarative section of the components
	component top_arch
		port(....)  // give a port list 
end component 

// done with declarative section, now we have to declare some intermediate signals (optional)
// they are the intermediate signals of c1, c2, c3: of the type std_logic;

begin // actual implementation
	m1: top_arch port map(...);
	m2: top_arch port map(...);
	m3: top_arch port map(...);
	m4: top_arch port map(...);
end;

// nesting components inside of a larger component until you have a larger component fully made.
