CHMOD
Chmod stands for 'change mode'. This allows us to change access permissions for
files.

Inside your home directory on Tesla, make a directory called practiceChmod.
(Don't do this on any directories already made.)
Inside, make a .txt file that just says "My name is [insert name here]." Call
the file name.txt.
After exiting VIM (or your text editor of choice), stay in the practiceChmod
directory. If you type ls -l, that is a long form of listing the contents of the
directory. You'll see a string listed first that's 10 characters long. This
string tells us the permissions of the file or directory (and if it's a file or
directory).

For example:
-rwx-wx-wx

The first character is either d or -. If the first character is a d, then that
item is a directory. If it's a dash, it's a file.
Think of everything after the first character as three sets of three (for a
total of 9 chars). You will either see an 'r', 'w', 'x', or '-'.
The 'r' stands for read
The 'w' stands for write
The 'x' stands for execute

___   ___   ___   ___   ___   ___   ___   ___   ___   ___
d      r     w     x
or     or    or    or
-      -     -     -
      |____USER______|  |___GROUP______|  |____WORLD_____|

Let's just think about the last 9 digits from now on (this is what we change
with chmod). If we have rwx------ as that string, then the user has read,
write, and execute privileges but no one else does.
Each one of these is a bit, either on (letter shown) or off (dash shown).
That example (last 9 digits only), would be
111 000 000
If we label r = 4, w = 2, and x = 1 (notice - in sets of three, these are
the fours place, twos place, and ones place), then having rwx all set would be
4 + 2 + 1 = 7.

Here are all the options:
0 = no permissions whatsoever; this person cannot read, write, or execute the file
1 = execute only
2 = write only
3 = write and execute (1+2)
4 = read only
5 = read and execute (4+1)
6 = read and write (4+2)
7 = read and write and execute (4+2+1)

What would running 'chmod 755 me.txt' do to the file?
What about 'chmod 622 me.txt'?
What about 'chmod 000 me.txt'?
