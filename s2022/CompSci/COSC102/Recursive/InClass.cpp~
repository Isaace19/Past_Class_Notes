/*Recursion is when a functionc alls itself, but we can think about this in terms of a porblem solving itself too*/

/*Components:

  -Base case - i.e. when to stop
  -Work Towards a sllution
  -Recursive Call 0 i.e. wen the function calls itself.

  The components don't have to be in this order, but having a recusrive call at the end is
  called "Tail recusrion"
