** Notes on how to do the extra credit of the PPM lab in 102
 

 * WE have a class file then a main file when we write code

  /*
    constructors
    methods
    all of these can be found in specific cpp/java files.

    when we have a class file, it can use everything inside the current
    directory such as when in robotics we have a mail file and then we have
    shooter clas, drivetrain class, camera class, etc.

    helps with compile time, you can compile one independent file instead of
    running an entire file of thousands of lines when you get to large projects.
    -
      make a file -> then we would make a cpp file for the class, main, and header

       main file - example.cpp, driver.cpp, HouseBluePrint.cpp

      header file - hold the signatures "outline" of the class, but not the body,
      i.e. the top part of vectors from scratch

       class file - definitions of the class listed in the header, things like
       rectangle.cpp, and doublefector.cpp
    -
    however, from our vectors from scratch file, we would be doing everything
    inside of one file

    why do we seperate these to 3 independent files
    -
      we can use it incase we have seperate files of main files that use the class
      and hpp files or utilization in different ways. 

      compiling and linking files together in order to work

      IN THE FUTURE - we will learn how to make our own "make file"

	Read into 202 notes over the summer

    * Take aways from this lesson
      header files are .hpp
      class files include a #include of a header file
      you should be able to recognize the difference
